# SR Case 2026: Algorithmic Curation & The Echo Chamber Effect
# Work in progress

## Project Overview
This project is a prototype of a social media feed algorithm developed for my SR Case at HANSENBERG Tekniske Gymnasium. My case combines **Kommunikation & IT A** and **Programmering B** to investigate the power of algorithms over information visibility and user behavior.

The application demonstrates how a "black box" algorithm learns from user patterns (specifically watch-time and interaction) to curate a personalized feed, and explores the social consequences of this curation.

## Core Features
- **Local C# Prototype:** A desktop application built using Windows Forms. 
- **Offline Logic:** All data processing and content sorting happen locally, simulating a server-side environment without requiring an external database.
- **Behavioral Tracking:** Tracks "linger time" (how long a user stays on a post) as a primary metric for interest, mirroring real-world algorithms like TikTok's.
- **Dynamic Re-ranking:** The feed updates in real-time or upon refresh to prioritize content the algorithm deems "relevant" to the user.
